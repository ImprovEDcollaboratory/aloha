Well, well, well. You've been here a whole 5 minutes and that's pretty great! 

Just in case you didn't already check it out, you might want to see what other groups we have that you might want to join. 

>If you can see your sidebar, go hover over the word "Channels" and click there. You'll see a list of all active, private, and archived channels. See one that interests you? Join it! (Read the Slack FAQ on this at https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels.) 

That about sums up everything you need to know about channels. Please help us stick to these same expectations if you decide to create a new channel. If you have a recommendation for updating our conventions, please share in the #_community-planning channel.
